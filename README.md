# Internship-Recommendation-System
AI-based system to recommend internships to students using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity.
# Internship Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle to find internships that match their skills, interests, and profiles, while organizations receive a large number of unsuitable applications.

## Objective
To design and implement an AI-based recommendation system that matches students with suitable internship opportunities based on profile similarity.

## Data Used
- Student profiles (skills, interests, academic background)
- Internship descriptions
(Note: Data used was collected/prepared for academic purposes.)

## Methodology
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Cosine Similarity for matching student profiles with internship descriptions
- Ranking internships based on similarity scores

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy

## Results
- The system successfully recommends relevant internships based on student profiles.
- Improved relevance compared to manual filtering.
- Results validated using sample test profiles.

## Limitations
- Depends on quality and completeness of input profiles
- Does not consider real-time internship availability
- Limited dataset size

## Project Status
Completed
